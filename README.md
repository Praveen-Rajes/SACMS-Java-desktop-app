# School Activity Club Management System (SACMS)

Welcome to the School Activity Club Management System (SACMS), a comprehensive system designed to streamline the management of extracurricular activity clubs within a school environment

## Project Overview
SACMS is built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, with Java as the primary programming language. The system aims to facilitate various aspects of club management, including club creation, event scheduling, user registration, attendance tracking, and reporting.

## Key Features
### a) Club Creation
Club advisors can create and manage club profiles.
### b) Event Scheduling
Club advisors can schedule events, meetings, and activities for their respective clubs.
### c) User Registration
Students can register with SACMS.
Students can select the clubs they wish to join during the registration process.
### d) Attendance Tracking
Club advisors can efficiently track attendance at club events.
### e) Reporting
The system generates reports on club membership.
Reports include details on event attendance and club activities.

## Implementation
The core classes for SACMS have been developed using Java, following Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system utilizes Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to implement a database layer for storing and retrieving user data, club information, and attendance records.

The user interface is implemented using JavaFX, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless user interactions.
